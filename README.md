## About the Chatbot - Meet Llamastar
Let's introduce you to the star of the show, Llamastar! This AI comedian bot was crafted using TheBloke's Llama-2-7B-chat-GPTQ model. But that's not all; I've spiced it up with Gradio and Langchain applications to provide you with an interactive and entertaining experience. Feel free to explore Llamastar's comedic talents and have a blast at the AI Comedy Club! ðŸŽ¤ðŸ˜„
